# Chatbot Leave Query Models

This repository contains the implementation of Decision Tree and Naive Bayes models for a chatbot capable of handling leave-related queries and providing general information. These models have been optimized and are ready for use.

## Models

### Decision Tree Model

The Decision Tree model has been trained and optimized to classify user queries into predefined categories, such as Greeting, Request, Query, Action, Closing, Contact Number, and General Information. The model demonstrates strong performance in understanding and responding to user inputs.
